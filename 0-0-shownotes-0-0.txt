Darwin Award

Alright everyone, gather around for this one. Our hero this time is Denis, from Quebec. Now Denis has a history with bad ideas. Years ago he decided he wanted a bear cub as a pet. How does he get one? By stealing it from its snarling mother and dragging it behind his jet-ski. That’s right. A bear cub. Behind a jet-ski. Quebec didn’t have any animal protection laws at the time, so he got away with it. And somehow, Denis is still with us today.

Fast forward a few years to the spring thaw. Denis is staring at the ice floes drifting down the Gatineau River near Ottawa. He looks at them and thinks, why not go for a ride. Not a little ride, not a casual paddle. A full-on extreme sport, on a tiny chunk of ice. Denis hops on his ice floe and sets off downstream like he invented winter.

Meanwhile, a woman is cleaning her car on the riverbank when she notices something strange. Someone is floating past. On a piece of ice. A man. Yes, Denis. She calls 911 and then casually says let’s watch. And watch they did. Denis is traveling fast because the current is swift and he is not exactly steering.
---
Of course, things go as you’d expect. The ice floe carries him straight to a hydro-boom above some rapids. He is now stranded on a 15-foot block of ice in the middle of the river. At this point you’d expect Darwin to be taking notes. But luck is on his side. Two young men in a rowboat heroically paddle out, grab Denis, and pull him to safety. No Darwin Award this time.

And when the police ask him what he was thinking, Denis gives the only answer that makes sense. I just felt like going for a ride.

So, what do we learn from Denis? First, never steal a bear cub. Second, ice floes are not transportation. And third, in Canada, apparently, extreme winter adventures and casual life-threatening decisions are just another Tuesday.

Ladies and gentlemen, let’s give it up for Denis. A man who proves that sometimes sheer luck is a survival skill and pure nonsense is a life strategy.

Black Friday

Alright, let’s talk about American Thanksgiving and Black Friday from a Canadian who’s worked in retail and restaurants. We don’t celebrate it at the same time, but I feel the pain. Turkey barely off the table, cranberry sauce still wobbling, and suddenly everyone’s elbowing each other for a $9 waffle maker like their lives depend on it. And the employees? Forget family, forget leftovers. They’re stuck in the chaos, sweating while corporate laughs all the way to the bank. I see you, I feel you, and I salute your suffering.

Every year Black Friday starts earlier and earlier. At this rate, next year it’ll kick off while they’re still carving the turkey. Gravy in one hand, credit card in the other, dodging Aunt Linda like she’s a human shopping barricade. And the deals barely matter. It’s chaos they’re after. Watching grown adults treat a toaster like it’s the Iron Throne. All for corporate greed. All for capitalism. And somehow, it’s sold as “holiday fun.”
---
And the emails! “Black Friday starts now!” No, psycho. It’s 5 pm on Thanksgiving. Some of us are still cooking, some are still working, some are still pretending to enjoy family. Calm down.

At this point, Black Friday isn’t about deals. It’s about watching humanity lose its mind for the entertainment of billion-dollar corporations. It’s like a live-action reality show where the prize is a slightly cheaper blender and the losers are everyone with a soul. While underpaid and overworked employees have to deal with all the crazy and every Karen.

---
So here are our Black Friday Rants!

Kitty - Black Friday: that magical time when your dignity is optional and your tolerance is zero.

Jon - ​My neighbor trained all year for this. He was doing box jumps and sprinting. For what? A $12 toaster?

k - Nothing screams consumerism like fighting someone for a TV you don’t need because the ad said “doorbuster.”

J - ​I don't need a 75-inch TV. My place is the size of a postage stamp. But I must have it because it is 50% off!

k - Who needs a peaceful morning when you can sprint through Target like you’re in the Olympics for a cheap waffle maker?

J - Everyone acts like they’re scoring a secret victory, but we're all just losing money slightly slower than usual.

k - You haven’t lived until you’ve seen a human being shoved out of a cart over a $7 set of spatulas.

J - The concept of "Cyber Monday" is proof that Black Friday is too aggressive even for capitalism.
---
k - Every Black Friday ad should just say, “Warning: You may hate humanity for 12 hours.”

J - Just bought three things I will forget I own by Tuesday. That's the Black Friday guarantee.

k - The true horror isn’t the deals. It’s the people who camp outside Walmart like it’s Coachella.

J - ​We should stop calling it Black Friday and call it "The Great Annual Consumer Madness Day."

k - Somehow, “limited stock” turns otherwise polite people into professional pushers.

J - ​I’m pretty sure I heard the dramatic swell of an orchestral score when two people reached for the last video game console

k - Black Friday is basically adult-level hide-and-seek, except the prize is a 40% off waffle iron and someone might break your nose.

J - ​I spent $50 on gas driving to six different stores to save $30 on electronics. I think I did the math wrong
---
k - Nothing says “holiday cheer” like elbow marks and sticky floors in a mall packed with screaming children and angry adults.

J - My cart is full of things I have zero storage space for. That's a problem for Future Me, who is also currently broke

k - Nothing builds character like circling a parking lot for 45 minutes while your family mutters threats about inanimate objects.

J - Why do the stores play Christmas music when people are clearly fighting for their lives over discounted cookware? It's jarring
