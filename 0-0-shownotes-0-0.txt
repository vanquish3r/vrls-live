USA/SNAP

I’m sitting here in Canada, watching the United States, and I can’t believe what I’m seeing.

The federal government is shut down. Millions of Americans, moms, dads, kids, seniors, are losing SNAP benefits. People who rely on food assistance, who already struggle to make ends meet, are being told they are not a priority. Health care subsidies are frozen. Families who depend on coverage are left in limbo, wondering how they will pay for medicine, for doctors, for the care they need to survive. Early childhood programs like Head Start, the programs that give vulnerable kids a chance to learn, to grow, to have a future, are paused. And the men and women in uniform, the people who protect their country and sacrifice every day, are not even guaranteed a paycheck.

And why is this happening? Because Donald Trump and the Republicans are treating people’s lives like a bargaining chip. They are choosing suffering over humanity. They are forcing hunger, fear, and uncertainty on families just to win political games. They are making the most vulnerable pay the price for their stubbornness and their greed.

It is cruel. It is unacceptable. And it is hard to watch from a distance without feeling the rage build up inside you. Because this is not just numbers on a page. This is children going to bed hungry. This is parents crying over bills they cannot pay. This is seniors skipping medication so they can eat. This is the human cost of choosing politics over people.
---
And it is painfully familiar. Here in Ontario, Doug Ford is showing us that we do not need to cross the border to see leadership that puts power over people. Cuts to programs, delays in support, decisions that make life harder for the most vulnerable. It is smaller in scale, but the disregard is the same. The same callousness. The same choice to put power over humanity.

Meanwhile, California is showing what leadership should look like. Gavin Newsom is stepping in where Trump refuses to act. He is fast tracking 80 million dollars to support food banks. He is deploying the National Guard to make sure families can eat. He is suing the Trump administration for illegally withholding SNAP benefits. He is putting people over politics. He is showing that leadership can protect those who need it the most.

This is the difference that leadership can make. This is the difference between hope and despair. Between a hot meal and an empty cupboard. Between a child learning in preschool and a child lost because no one cared enough to fund the program.
---
I am watching from Canada in disbelief, heartbroken and furious. I am thinking about the millions of people, here and there, who are being punished because of politics. I am thinking about the children who will go hungry tonight, the parents who cannot sleep because they do not know how to feed their family tomorrow, the people who serve and sacrifice without guarantee of pay.

One of our own, DivineSlayer, is being directly impacted by this shutdown. She has shared links in the Discord Off Topic channel for anyone who wants to help. 

We cannot stand by and do nothing. We cannot let politics destroy lives. Enough is enough. It’s time to stop shrugging off the chaos like it’s just another headline and start reminding those in power who they actually work for. 
---
The No Kings protests are proof that people are done being silent, that voices raised together can shake the ground beneath even the most stubborn leaders. We can write, speak, march, vote, and refuse to look away. Every single one of us has a part to play in saying no to greed, no to corruption, no to cruelty disguised as policy. Change starts when we stop waiting for someone else to fix it and realize that someone is us.

Thank you.

3I/ATLAS

Kitty: Good evening, everyone! Welcome back to The VR Late Show. I’m Kitty, and with me is Dutch, the man who once tried to toast a marshmallow with a laser pointer.

Dutch: It worked for a second before the marshmallow exploded, and honestly, that second was glorious.

Kitty: You call it science. I call it a cry for help.

Dutch: It’s called experimentation, Kitty. That’s how humanity advances. Speaking of things flying too close to a light source and burning out spectacularly, let’s talk about 3I/ATLAS.

Kitty: Nice segue. So, for anyone who hasn’t been keeping up with cosmic gossip, 3I/ATLAS is a brand new interstellar object that’s just entered our solar system. Basically, space got bored and threw us a curveball.
---
Dutch: This thing’s not from around here. It’s the third interstellar visitor we’ve ever spotted. You know how people say “third time’s the charm”? Yeah, well, this one might just prove them wrong.

Kitty: Discovered by the ATLAS telescope network in Chile. Which is basically a team of giant robot eyes staring into space going, “Hey, what’s that shiny thing doing here?”

Dutch: And it’s moving ridiculously fast. We’re talking “late for work and forgot your pants” fast.

Kitty: I’ve had those mornings.

Dutch: You and half the audience. But here’s the thing — this comet isn’t following normal rules. Instead of slowly brightening as it gets closer to the Sun, it’s suddenly glowing like it just remembered it left the oven on.
---
Kitty: Yeah, scientists said it’s brightening faster than expected. My theory? It’s just trying to get noticed. You know how influencers suddenly post five selfies when engagement drops? Same vibe.

Dutch: Some telescopes even picked up that it’s glowing blue. Not “sad breakup” blue. More like “cosmic nightclub with good lighting” blue.

Kitty: Which means it’s full of gas. So in short, this comet’s bright, dramatic, and full of hot air. Sounds familiar.

Dutch: Hey now. I prefer “atmospherically dynamic.”

Kitty: Sure, Dutch. Keep telling yourself that. Anyway, 3I/ATLAS started venting water and ice way earlier than comets usually do. Most wait till they’re nice and toasty near the Sun. This one’s like, “I don’t need your heat, I’m self-motivated.”
---
Dutch: It’s basically that friend who shows up early to every event, rearranges the snacks, and tells you they’re just “helping.”

Kitty: Oh, so you have met my aunt.

Dutch: This space rock is doing its own thing, flying in from another star system, shining bright blue, and then jetting off again forever. Kind of like an ex who texts “I miss you” and then vanishes into the void.

Kitty: At least this one’s prettier. It’s expected to reach its closest point to the Sun right about now, somewhere near Mars’ orbit, then it’s heading straight back into deep space.
---
Dutch: So no collision, no alien invasions, just a cool cosmic drive-by.

Kitty: Still, it’s pretty amazing that we can track something flying millions of kilometres away and figure out its chemistry, colour, and attitude problem.

Dutch: And scientists are pumped because every interstellar visitor helps us learn more about what’s floating around between the stars. Basically, space archaeology.

Kitty: Without all the dirt and whips.

Dutch: Speak for yourself. I look great in a fedora.

Kitty: You look like you’re about to host a cooking show for snakes.

Dutch: Fair. But seriously, this comet’s unpredictable behaviour might even rewrite a few science textbooks.

Kitty: Which is great news for all the high school kids who just finished exams.
---
Dutch: Can’t wait for the next interstellar object. Maybe one shaped like a donut. Scientists could call it “3I/Timbit.”

Kitty: Perfect. Canada finally gets representation in the cosmos.

Dutch: I’d salute that flag.

Kitty: So if you’re stargazing tonight and see a bright blue streak that doesn’t belong, it’s probably 3I/ATLAS saying hello before taking off forever.

Dutch: Kind of like when you see me at work — here one minute, gone the next.

Kitty: That’s because you disappear every time someone mentions “meeting.”
---
Dutch: I believe in delegation.

Kitty: Sure you do. Anyway, that’s our cosmic update for the night. A blue comet from another solar system crashing the party and showing us all up.

Dutch: Which feels like the perfect mood for tonight’s show — fast, weird, and a little unpredictable.

Kitty: Just how we like it.

Dutch: Alright folks, grab your snacks, strap in, and let’s get this show moving. Because if 3I/ATLAS can make headlines by just showing up, so can we.

Kitty: On with the show!

Thank You Notes

kitty - “Dear Extraterrestrials, thank you for coming all this way. We apologize for the screaming children, the traffic, and the smell of actual garbage.”

Dutch - “Thank you, alien probes… for proving once and for all that even advanced civilizations still believe in butt stuff.”

k - “Thank you for not abducting our Wi-Fi. Seriously, losing TikTok mid-scroll would have been catastrophic.”

D - “Thank you, aliens… for returning abductees completely naked.
Nothing says ‘We respect your species’ like teleporting them home bare-assed at dawn.”

k - “Thank you for not probing our neighbors instead. Seriously, Jerry from 3B would have screamed for three days straight.”

D - “Thank you… aliens… for always abducting people from small towns.
Apparently, your interstellar scavenger hunt prize is a guy named Earl with two teeth and a six-pack of Busch Light.”
---
k - “Thank you for studying humans. We apologize for our obsession with glowing rectangles — we call them phones.”

D - “Thank you… abduction stories… for always ending with, ‘And then I woke up in my truck with no pants.’
Yeah, sure, Dutch… definitely aliens… not tequila.”

k - “Thank you for visiting Earth. We hope our cats didn’t terrorize you too much — they’re just practicing to take over the world.”

D - “Thank you… aliens… for disguising yourselves as humans.
Honestly, that explains half the VR community.”

k - “Thank you for coming all this way. We hope our planet met your expectations… or at least wasn’t too disappointing.”

D - “Thank you… abductees… for describing the aliens as ‘smooth and hairless.’
Oh cool — so basically me and Vanquish3r after wax night.”
---
k - “Thank you for lending us your universal translator. It turns out our plants have been judging us all along.”

D - “Thank you… UFO sightings… for always being filmed on a Motorola Razr from 2004.
Apparently, aliens have cloaking technology that’s allergic to 1080p.”

k - “Thank you for stopping by. We apologize for our obsession with pizza toppings.”

D - “Thank you… aliens… for doing experiments on humans.
Because when you look at us eating Tide Pods and arguing about flat Earth, I get it — you’re curious how we’re even alive.”

k - “Dear Intergalactic Guests, thank you for not stealing all our cows. Seriously, Bessie is very attached to her Instagram account.”

D - “Thank you… aliens… for trying to communicate with us telepathically.
They couldn’t get through to me because Kitty’s keyboard was louder than the cosmic background radiation.”

k - “Hey Cosmic Buddies, thanks for the advanced technology. We promise not to immediately break it... hopefully”

D - “Thank you… aliens… for calling the VR Late Show ‘the most accurate representation of Earth culture.’
So congratulations, folks — humanity’s legacy is bad jokes, loud typing, and one big Hitachi wand.”

Probe Or Pass

Alright everyone, it’s time for Probe or Pass! Here’s how it works: I’ll ask you some tough, alien-flavored ‘this or that’ questions, and you have to choose. ‘Probe’ if you’re game, ‘Pass’ if you’re… not. Let’s see what kind of intergalactic chaos you’re up for!

Would you talk to a black hole or argue with a nebula?

Would you have hands made of marshmallows or feet made of spaghetti?

Would you spend a week stuck inside an alien vending machine or an intergalactic closet?

Would you grow wings every time you laugh or three eyes every time you cry?

Would you attend a zero-gravity concert or a black hole karaoke night?

---
Would you go on a blind date with a shape-shifting alien or a hologram version of yourself?

Would you ride a rollercoaster through a supernova or a carnival ride on a black hole?

Would you play fetch with a telepathic dog or a levitating cat?

Would you have hair made of space slime or teeth made of tiny stars?

Would you live in zero gravity or in an atmosphere made of whipped cream?

---
Would you get a tattoo that glows across galaxies or one that talks back?

Would you adopt an alien pet that rearranges your furniture or one that changes colors constantly?

Would you join an intergalactic improv team or a zero-gravity choir?

Would you go to school taught by a floating brain or a talking comet?

Would you babysit alien babies with three heads or alien babies with six arms?

---
Darwin Award

Alright everyone, strap in. This next near miss comes to us from Boston, Massachusetts, courtesy of ROCK 92.9. And it’s a classic case of “I just have to get this on my phone” going very, very wrong.

So picture this. A guy is driving along, probably thinking about lunch, maybe singing along to the radio. And then, out of nowhere, he sees something weird in the sky. Something he swears is a UFO. His heart races, adrenaline pumps, and suddenly, the mundane act of driving becomes a high-stakes mission to document extraterrestrial life.

Now, most of us would glance, maybe slow down. Not this guy. No, no. He pulls out his phone, hits record, and stares at the sky like he’s about to win the intergalactic Oscar for best amateur footage. I can hear him whispering to himself, “I’m gonna get this… they’re real… they’re finally real…” Meanwhile, the road in front of him might as well not exist.
---
And the more he focuses on UFO perfection, the worse it gets. He’s weaving a little, maybe narrowly missing a mailbox, maybe honking at a squirrel, maybe thinking he’s on some cosmic scavenger hunt. You can feel the tension building. He’s one glorious UFO selfie away from viral fame. And then… BAM.

Yep. He crashes into a pole. That’s it. No alien tractor beams, no glowing lights whisking him away, no interstellar abduction. Just a very confused man, a very angry telephone pole, and one very regretted life choice.

Guess The Song

Kitty - Avril Lavigne - Kiss Me Like The World Is Ending

Tick-tock, I should've known the time was coming
Yeah, it's just like me to be kinda all or nothin'
I can't stop, try to catch me if you can
I was born on the run, but I'll die holding your hands, yeah

The stars shine for the two of us (two of us)
So sweet and mysterious
Got a question, baby, truth or dare?
Spin the bottle, I'll be waiting there, yeah

---
Dutch - Journey - Don’t Stop Believin’

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some'll win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Whoa, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

---
Kitty - Nico Vega - Be Giving

I'm gonna drive off naked with the top down
Even if I don't make it to the next town
I'm gonna sleep on the floor tonight cause
I don't need a damn bed to survive on

Chains, cut the chains
See the world as a brother and a sister now
Chains, cut the chains
See the world as a brother and a sister

---
Dutch - Red Hot Chili Peppers - Under The Bridge

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city, she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

---
Kitty - Goo Goo Dolls - Name

And scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there
Did you get to be a star?
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are?

We grew up way too fast
And now there's nothing to believe
And reruns all become our history
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio

---
Dutch - Green Day - Boulevard of Broken Dreams

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge, and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone

---
Kitty - Train - Meet Virginia

Well, she wants to be the Queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Pulls her hair back as she screams
"I don't really wanna be the queen"

Her daddy wrestles alligators
Mama works on carburetors
Her brother is a fine mediator for the President
Well, here she is again on the phone
Just like me hates to be alone
We just like to sit at home and rip on the President

---
Dutch - Michael Jackson - Smooth Criminal

As he came into the window
It was the sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet

She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down
It was her doom

---
Kitty - Ed Sheeran - Galway Girl

Now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night

I walked her home then she took me inside
Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm going to put you in a song that I write

---
Dutch - Fleetwood Mac - Dreams

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Oh, thunder only happens when it's rainin'
Players only love you when they're playin'
Say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know
