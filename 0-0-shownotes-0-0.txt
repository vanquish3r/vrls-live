National Days
==================================

Title: “Love at First Fright”

Premise:
One brave contestant (“The Dater”) sits in the Coffin of Love while four mysterious suitors—each embodying a classic monster—compete for their undead heart. The dater can only hear their voices and ask questions before choosing one to reveal for a final “fright date.”

🕸️ Monster Contestants

Each plays it completely in character, leaning into campy tropes.
    
Count Vlad the Charmer — A smooth-talking vampire who’s all about “long walks at night” and “sharing a bite.”
Personality: Romantic, melodramatic, too many puns about “fangs” and “eternal love.”
    
Frankie Sparks — Frankenstein’s monster rebranded as a gentle hunk trying to “piece his life together.”
Personality: Earnest but slow, literal-minded, keeps saying “My heart beats… sometimes.”
    
Luna Howlstrom — A werewolf influencer who insists she’s “not toxic, just lunar-cyclical.”
Personality: Wild energy, flirty, growls when excited. Keeps checking her moon app.
    
Mummy Dearest — A sarcastic, emotionally wrapped-up mummy who complains about being “tied down.”
Personality: Sassy, dry humor, dramatic eye rolls through the bandages. 
🎃 Gameplay Format

Round 1 – “The Haunting Icebreakers”

Describe your idea of the perfect moonlit date night.
    •    What part of yourself do people find… most shocking?
    •    If love were a potion, what forbidden ingredient would you add?
    •    What’s your biggest red flag… besides the literal blood one?
    •    What makes you a killer catch?


Round 2 – “Monster Confessions”
Each contestant reveals a “dark secret” about their dating history.
Audience cheers or boos based on how spooky, cringe, or relatable it is.

Round 3 – “The Big Reveal”
The dater picks one monster for their “Love at First Fright.”

🎃 Near Miss Darwin Award: The Halloween Horror Movie Gone Wrong

Alright folks, this next near miss comes to us straight from North Carolina, where one college student decided Halloween was the perfect time to make his big break as a horror filmmaker.

He had it all planned out. A fake chainsaw, a creepy mask, and a bucket of fake blood that looked way too real. The plan? Film a dramatic chase scene through his neighbourhood in the middle of the night. Because apparently, nothing screams “great idea” like sprinting down suburban streets, covered in blood, waving a weapon, while your buddy films from the bushes.

So they set up the scene. The camera’s rolling. The “killer” bursts onto the street in full costume, fake blood dripping everywhere, chainsaw revving. He’s chasing his friend who’s screaming and running for dear life. It looks amazing. Like something straight out of a slasher movie.

What they didn’t think about… was the neighbours.

One lady steps outside to let her dog pee, looks up, and sees a maniac sprinting across her lawn. Blood everywhere. Chainsaw in hand. She drops her coffee, grabs her phone, and immediately calls 911.

---
Within minutes, the whole neighbourhood’s lit up like a Christmas tree. Police cars, sirens, the whole deal. One officer said later they got three different calls claiming there was a killer on the loose.

Meanwhile, our aspiring director is still filming, totally unaware he’s about to star in Cops: Halloween Edition. He’s yelling, “Keep going, it looks great!” and then sees the flashing lights.

The “killer” panics, tosses the chainsaw, and starts screaming, “It’s fake! It’s fake!” while trying to wipe corn syrup off his face like that’s going to help.

The cops roll up, guns drawn, shouting for him to get on the ground. This poor guy’s seconds away from getting tased when one officer finally picks up the chainsaw, looks at it, and goes, “...It doesn’t even have a blade.”

That’s when the reality sets in. The neighbours are traumatized, the actors are crying, and the director’s sitting on the curb in fake blood and shame. The cops confiscate the footage, and his dreams of cinematic glory go right into evidence.

So tonight, we raise a candy corn salute to you, Mr. Halloween Filmmaker. You almost earned yourself a Darwin Award for “death by realism,” but instead, you just gave half your neighbourhood trust issues and your mom a heart attack.

🎃 “Now Hiring: The Monster in Middle Management”

Premise

It’s a mock job interview at a paper supply company (a tongue-in-cheek nod to “The Office”). The manager, an overly polite but awkward corporate type, is interviewing Frankenstein’s Monster for a mid-level position. The skit plays like a mix of The Office and Young Frankenstein with a late-night show energy—quick banter, absurd moments, and audience interaction.

Cast
    •    Manager (Human): uptight, chipper, all buzzwords and HR jargon.
    •    Frankenstein’s Monster: deeply earnest, misunderstood, trying to prove he’s “a team player” despite… breaking things.

🎃 THE VR LATE SHOW: HALLOWEEN HAVOC (MAD LIBS EDITION)

It was a dark and [ADJECTIVE] night in Banter Studio, and the VR Late Show was about to begin. The lights flickered as Slinky entered, dressed as a [HALLOWEEN COSTUME], holding a [SPOOKY OBJECT] that definitely wasn’t OSHA-approved.

Divineslayer appeared next, doing the [SILLY DANCE MOVE] while chanting “[CREEPY PHRASE]!” over and over. Staticthreat was backstage trying to [VERB] the haunted fog machine, but instead accidentally summoned [PLURAL SUPERNATURAL CREATURES] that started [VERB ENDING IN -ING] around the audience.

Kilo arrived late, blaming a [HALLOWEEN-RELATED EXCUSE], and immediately tripped over a [OBJECT], landing in a pile of [GOOEY SUBSTANCE]. Simon was trying to keep things on track, but DutchJones was too busy [VERB ENDING IN -ING] with a [ADJECTIVE] pumpkin that seemed to be whispering “[CREEPY SENTENCE]” to him.
---
CaptnDan, dressed as a [RIDICULOUS COSTUME MASHUP], tried to regain control by yelling, “Everyone calm your [BODY PART PLURAL]!” but Constantine had already started [VERB ENDING IN -ING] a mysterious potion that glowed [COLOUR] and smelled like [FOOD ITEM].

The audience screamed as the lights went out. When they flicked back on, Slinky was standing on the stage holding [OBJECT], Divine was laughing like a [CREATURE], and Kilo was nowhere to be found—only a trail of [HALLOWEEN ITEM PLURAL] leading to the exit.

By the end, Staticthreat sighed, “Well… that was [ADJECTIVE],” and DutchJones grinned, holding up the pumpkin. “Nah,” he said, “that was [ADJECTIVE].”
